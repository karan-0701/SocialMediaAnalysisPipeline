Stance Detection Model
This repository trains a BERT-based stance detection model to classify text into four categories:

Pro-Palestine

Pro-Israel

Neutral

Irrelevant

It uses Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and a custom training pipeline to fine-tune a bert-base-uncased model.

How It Works
The model is trained to detect stance from short social media texts (e.g., tweets or captions). Each input text is classified into one of the four predefined stance categories.

The data is split into training, validation, and test sets, tokenized using BERT tokenizer, and passed to a sequence classification head for fine-tuning.

Input Dataset Format
Your dataset should be a CSV file with at least the following two columns:

text	label
"We stand with Palestine."	Pro-Palestine
"I don't care about politics"	irrelevant

The label column must contain one of:
Pro-Palestine, Pro-Israel, Neutral, or irrelevant

Command-Line Usage
Run the training script using the module interface:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m stance_model.main <csv_path> [--epochs N]
CLI Arguments
Argument	Type	Description
<csv_path>	str	Path to the input dataset CSV file (required)
--epochs	int	Number of training epochs (default: 3)

Example
Train for 5 epochs using dataset/stance_data.csv:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m stance_model.main dataset/stance_data.csv --epochs 5
Installation
Clone the repository:
